      <div class="box">
        <p>Zodiac is just as inspiring as it is accurate--and it has something for everyone.
<br>
I've written and deleted several paragraphs on how wonderful the chemistry is, the score is, the cinematography is, the attention to detail is, and so on and so forth for so many words.
Watching Zodiac truly feels like being in the room where it happens.
Every last detail is crafted to immerse the watcher entirely, and it succeeds beautifully.
<br>
The third act is brought to life by all that preceeds it; but the star is Gyllenhaal.
As Robert Graysmith--former cartoonist and author of the book Zodiac--Gyllenhaal's flexibility and acting skills illustrate the man's transformation from a dorkish father to a dogged devotee to unmasking the killer in a cold case.
<br>
Of course, there's so, so much more that could be talked about, but these were the most important parts to me.
If you have two and a half hours to spare, open up Netflix and experience it firsthand.

      <h2 id="darko">Entry 2. Donnie Darko</h2>
      <h6>Date: 9/21/20 - Stars: 4/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Donnie Darko is a work of art that's equal parts compelling, horrifying, and thought-provoking.
<br>
It's hard to delve into what's lovable about this film with getting into spoilers, but I'll do my best.
This film uses story devices (horror tropes, teenage angst, etc.) as vehicles to drop ideas and questions at your doorstep.
From a personal scale, to familial, to paranormal, to cosmic; shit gets wacky.
<br>
Following the titular protagonist's journey throughout the film is hard.
He easily earns sympathy, and that's what make the horrors he faces painful to sit through--especially as some of them are easy to connect with.
It feels so layered and so real, even to the point where it might be uncomfortable for some viewers.
<br>
To wrap it up nicely:
The horror isn't the grotesque bunny suit, it's everything that comes with.
