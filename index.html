        <p>Zodiac is just as inspiring as it is accurate--and it has something for everyone.
<br>
I've written and deleted several paragraphs on how wonderful the chemistry is, the score is, the cinematography is, the attention to detail is, and so on and so forth for so many words.
Watching Zodiac truly feels like being in the room where it happens.
Every last detail is crafted to immerse the watcher entirely, and it succeeds beautifully.
<br>
The third act is brought to life by all that preceeds it; but the star is Gyllenhaal.
As Robert Graysmith--former cartoonist and author of the book Zodiac--Gyllenhaal's flexibility and acting skills illustrate the man's transformation from a dorkish father to a dogged devotee to unmasking the killer in a cold case.
<br>
Of course, there's so, so much more that could be talked about, but these were the most important parts to me.
If you have two and a half hours to spare, open up Netflix and experience it firsthand.

      <h2 id="darko">Entry 2. Donnie Darko</h2>
      <h6>Date: 9/21/20 - Stars: 4/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Human.<br>
  If I had to choose one word to describe Donnie Darko--the movie or the character--I would use human.<br>
  Nobody was assigned hero at birth.
Characters developed into who they were by circumstances forced upon them, and how they chose to respond.
There's a philosophical theme to the film that touches on religion, pre-determined fate, and smurf genitals.
The things we base our lives around, the things that scare us, and the things no one could've predicted.<br>
  As a character, Donnie Darko is impossibly easy to relate to and sympathize with.
As a movie, Donnie Darko hides serious, legitimate thoughts in a rabbit suit.
The scariest part isn't what's marketed.<br>
  Regardless, if you have some time to mull over existential and emotional questions in a safe environment, try watching it.</p>
