      <h2 id="zodiac">Entry 1. Zodiac</h2>
      <h6>Date: 9/20/20 - Stars: 5/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>With a little something for everyone, Zodiac makes for a killer movie night pick.
This film boasts an immersive score and captivating cinematography.
The writing and the chemistry between actors feels natural, and it's fun seeing familiar faces in different places.
It's easy to feel like you're actually there.
<br>
For the most part, this movie sticks closely to the true events.
Something to be appreciated is that Zodiac doesn't actually focus on the titular killer.
Instead, the spotlight is focused on the ones whose lives were reshaped in their plight to bring him to light.
<br>
There's something inspiring about this movie, and that something is worth watching for.
</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="darko">Entry 2. Donnie Darko</h2>
      <h6>Date: 9/21/20 - Stars: 5/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Donnie Darko is a work of art that's equal parts compelling, horrifying, and thought-provoking.
<br>
It's hard to delve into what's lovable about this film with getting into spoilers, but I'll do my best.
This film uses story devices (horror tropes, teenage angst, etc.) as vehicles to drop ideas and questions at your doorstep.
From a personal scale, to familial, to paranormal, to cosmic; stuff gets wacky.
<br>
Following the titular protagonist's journey throughout the film is easy to start but hard to sit through.
He easily earns sympathy, and that's what make the horrors he faces painful to see--especially as some of them are easy to connect with.
It feels so layered and so real, even to the point where it might be uncomfortable for some viewers.
<br>
To close:
The horror isn't the grotesque bunny suit, it's everything that comes with.
</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1zT1sDv5Yvo">And boy, is that a lot.</a></p>

       <h2 id="enemy">Entry 3. Enemy</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/2/20 - Stars: 2/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
An artsy movie telling an unclear story, Enemy (2013) cycles its focus between Jake Gyllenhaal, spiders, and sex. 
I'm something of a Jake Gyllenhaal fan--I'm trying to be, at least--and I love spiders, so I vibed with those. 
The sex? Not so much.
It's a matter of preference, but the quantities of nudity and onscreen 'relations' came across as gratuitous. 
Aside from that, the last primary element I detected was depressed people having mental breakdowns. 
Repeat those four things for an hour and a half, and that's the movie!
<br>
Moving on, the plot was decent, albeit muddy at times. 
The concept of having a doppelgänger is fascinating, and Gyllenhaal executes both characters wonderfully. 
Props to him for giving 110% as always. 
The supporting actresses Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon play their roles well. 
If nothing else, this movie boasts excellent actors.
<br>
To conclude, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you love speculation, and you're comfortable with nudity. 
All in all, I don't regret watching Enemy, and I'm looking forward to the next movie on my list.

      </div>
      <h2 id="tdat">Entry 4. The Day After Tomorrow</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/4/20 - Stars: 4/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
       <p>
The Day After Tomorrow (2004) is a visually appealing movie with characters and relationships that are easy to get invested in. 
<br>
First off, Dennis Quaid--of the Parent Trap fame--is here! 
(Up until five minutes ago, I though he was in Jurassic Park. Whoops.) 
He and Jake Gyllenhaal star respectively as the father and son protagonists, Jack and Sam Hall. 
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, Sam's a dork, and they're both likable. 
The focus switches between several groups of characters, and at no point did I tire of any of them. 
Balancing personalities, plot relevance, screentime, and emotional investment across character groups isn't easy; but this movie pulls it off incredibly well. 
<br>
This film's premise depends on climate change. 
Other political thoughts in the same left-leaning vein are touched on. 
If you're a conservative, just cover your ears or something. 
<br>
Striking visuals and likable characters sold this movie for me. 
A solidly great movie, The Day After Tomorrow earned its place in my action-adventure blockbuster heart.

      <h2 id="southpaw">Entry 5. Southpaw</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/6/20 - Stars: 5/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
A little Hope for the Christmas season, eh?
<br>
I entered Southpaw (2015) with a handful of spoilers and an expectancy to be emotionally gutted. 
Well, spoilers couldn't lessen the story's punches, but I did hit the nail on the head with my prediction on emotional impact. 
This movie hits.
<br>
Billy Hope as a character is executed masterfully. 
I'm aware I always dedicate a sentence or two to fanboying over Jake Gyllenhaal's acting, but come on man!
His range, dedication, and proficiency in portraying--and doing justice to--each role he's given, is something I admire greatly. 
<br>
Right off the bat, Billy felt <em>different</em>.
There's so much to his character and where his character comes from, and it shines through in a really raw and human way. 
His lows devastated; his highs resonated.
Also, the guy's built like a Greek god-
<br>
Anyways! 
The soundtrack goes hard. 
I'm not much of an Eminem guy, but I was solidly hyped whenever I heard him spitting bars. 
<br>
Stopping it here to avoid rambling for too long, I'm definitely watching this movie again some day.
There's nothing like a little Hope to warm your heart and I'm sorry about the puns but they're so easy-
</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="life">Entry 6. Life</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/10/20 - Stars: 4/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
Wow. 
Just wow, really. 
I'm not much of a horror guy; the closest I've gotten to the genre is what... Venom and Donnie Darko? 
Luckily for me, Life (2017) hits the sci-fi alien stuff of Venom and the Gyllenhaal factor of Donnie Darko. 
Also, blood. 
Lots of blood. 
<br>
On today's episode of <em>How Can I Explain My Feelings Toward This Movie Without Spoiling It</em>; I bring you Ryan Reynolds appreciation. 
Tomorrow, who knows?
<br>
Okay, okay, enough silly jokes. 
The ship's crew is tight-knit, characterized with a trait or two each, and like a family. 
Some of the bonding moments may feel slow, but it humanizes them. 
The cinematography was the only thing to make me swoon more than man-crush of the century Ryan Reynolds. 
He's a gem for every scene he's in, and lovable throughout--without undermining serious moments.
Why couldn't my special interest be in <strong>his</strong> movies, I ask?
Why did it have to be Jake Gyllenhaal? 
Why does God give His hardest battles to His sexiest soldiers?
<br>
What was I doing again? 
Oh, right. 
Movie review. 
<br>
Fun fact! 
Life was thought by some to be a prequel to Venom, and I can't say they're entirely wrong. 
The gore and horror in this movie is exactly what I would've expected from Venom--had it been rated R, I mean. 
Watching the blood float around in zero-grav is pretty sweet. 
Sweet as in disturbing and uncomfortable, but in a cool way.
God help you if you're squeamish!
<br>
All in all, this is a really good movie. 
I enjoyed it a surprising amount, given that it's outside my normal genre tastes. 
4 stars!
</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="demo">Entry 7. Demolition</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/13/20 - Stars: 6/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
When I constructed this list of Jake Gyllenhaal movies to watch, I placed Demolition (2015) by the top.
One look, and I fell in love with this film's concept.
"Demolition."
I'm a creative type--I draw, I write, I took a spin at dancing last year--but something about destruction appeals to me.
Especially destruction as a form of... healing, or growth.
Enamoured with an idea, my expectations for this movie soared straight to the top.
<br>
I can't emphasize enough how much Demolition resonated with me, but the 6 stars should hint at it.
<br>
Demolition earns its praise for a realistic portrayal of grief--aka the only thing people talk about when it comes to this movie.
Past that, though, are so many other elements worthy of admiring.
<br>
The cinematography and editing were pleasing, and they told a story all on their own.
It was like being there, or seeing the world through Davis's (the main character's) eyes.
Also, Davis was a gem in a roster of gems.
He's easy to sympathize with, though following his train of thought is occasionally a wild ride.
<br>
The next notable gem is a kid (Chris) played by Judah Lewis.
He reminds me of a younger self, and he's easily my favorite character.
Any teenager that isn't constantly annoying gets points in my book; but the realism to Chris's character traits--and the acting to do them justice--truly make him worth sticking around for.
His friendship with Davis is another major plus for me. 
Intergenerational friendship / found family tropes have a very special place in my NOT DADDY ISSUES soul.
<br>
On the subject of elements that have real estate in my soul, this movie has more of them than I imagined it could.
Between destructive impulse, seabags, identity, live drums, and dancing around in a pair of headphones and shades; Demolition was a drive down memory lane.
<br>
It felt personal. 
Deeply personal.
<br>
I couldn't tear my eyes away for a moment.
Once the first scene passed, I stayed glued to the screen up until the credits rolled.
I'll admit that I tend to fidget during movies, but this movie held my attention in a grip I haven't felt since, what, Avengers: Endgame?
Demolition has carved out its own place in my pantheon of favorite movies--and I'll be shocked if anything else surpasses it.
</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="bros">Entry 8. Brothers</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/18/20 - Stars: 3/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
Brothers (2009) follows a pair of, well, brothers. 
Tobey Maguire leads as the good sibling Sam Cahill, while Jake Gyllenhaal isn't far behind as the 'screw-up' Tommy Cahill. 
As the third protagonist, Natalie Portman plays Grace, Sam's wife. 
The difference between Sam's half of the story and Tommy's is night and day, leaving my feelings toward this movie lukewarm.
<br>
First off, the cast immediately left stars in my eyes. 
Of course I'm gonna watch the movie with Spider-Man and Padme Amidala! 
<br>
When nobody's fighting, the family dynamics are absolutely wonderful; but the warmth they give is matched only by the bitter cold Sam experiences overseas--and brings back home. 
It's more emotionally troubling than graphically, but I'll admit Sam's voice cracks pulled me out of several intense moments.
As the movie progressed and his PTSD worsened, however, there was no distraction from the horrors that hollowed him out.
I expected a shell of his former self, but there were still pieces of him there.
That hurt more.
<br>
Back home, Tommy looks after his sister-in-law and nieces, making a half-decent Hallmark movie for whoever wants it. 
He starts off rather frustrating--how do you <em>not</em> like peas, man?--but he gets some very nice character growth and heartwarming moments with his family. 
Tommy is the scruffy-looking uncle of the year for me.
<br>
Grace is the most compelling of the main three characters, level-headed and a caring mother even through grief.
<br>
In conclusion, this movie is good, but it doesn't quite strike my personal chords.
I'd reccommend Brothers, I'd watch it again, but it's not special to me.
</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="prisoners">Entry 9. Prisoners</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/21/20 - Stars: 5/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
Out of all the movies I've watched for this project, none of them got me emotionally like Prisoners (2013). 
Through careful cinematography, brilliant acting, and heart-wrenching story twists that leave you on the edge of your seat; this movie is a gripping, hard-hitting mystery. 
<br>
At its core, the film is about a father who wants his daughter back. 
From layer to layer and choice to consequence, that fact is unwavering. 
<br>
Characters have depth to them, and you can't trust first impressions on whether anyone is a monster, a hero, or a victim. 
The acting and the dynamics sold me from the start, but only got more captivating as time went on. 
Everyone's on their A-game here.
<br>
One thing I specifically appreciate is the use of silence. 
Time to breathe, or process, or punctuate a heavy moment. 
Cozy, chilling, or downright cold; each scene is backed by an atmosphere that holds masterfully.
<br>
There's a religious undertone that feels like it should have a better resolution, but it doesn't detract from the plot.
If anything, it's an element that stays even after the cozy family dynamic is stripped away, and it shines an interesting light on different characters' morality. 
<br>
Watching troubling choices play out can be hard to stomach, but the movie knows when to hold back. 
It's graphic, not gratuitous. 
The line is a thin one, but the movie walks it well.
<br>
Some things can be predicted, but a lot of points come out of left field to keep you on your toes.
Unless you've seen this movie before, it's gonna take you to the end to piece together the whole story--as it should be.
<br>
Start to finish, Prisoners (2013) is--no pun intended--captivating. 
It's a beautifully crafted story done cinematic justice, and I won't be shutting up about it for a while.
