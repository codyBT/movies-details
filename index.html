      <div class="box">
        <p>With a little something for everyone, Zodiac makes for a killer movie night film.
<br>
I wasn't so sure about this Jake Gyllenhaal movie project at first.
It's a great concept and all, but going through with it was entirely different from making some layouts and writing a couple of lists.
Opening Netflix, I decided that I'd try out Zodiac--if I liked what I saw, I'd watch more.
If not, I'd move on to the next idea.
<br>
As you can see, I'm following through with this movie project.
<br>
Zodiac has an immersive score and captivating cinematography.
The writing and the chemistry between actors feels natural, and it's fun seeing familiar faces in different places.
It's easy to feel like you're actually there.
<br>
For the most part, this movie sticks closely to the true events.
Something to be appreciated is that Zodiac doesn't actually focus on the titular killer.
Instead, the spotlight is focused on the ones whose lives were reshaped in their plight to bring him to light.
<br>
There's something inspiring about this movie, and that something is worth watching for.
</p>

      <h2 id="darko">Entry 2. Donnie Darko</h2>
      <h6>Date: 9/21/20 - Stars: 4/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Donnie Darko is a work of art that's equal parts compelling, horrifying, and thought-provoking.
<br>
It's hard to delve into what's lovable about this film with getting into spoilers, but I'll do my best.
This film uses story devices (horror tropes, teenage angst, etc.) as vehicles to drop ideas and questions at your doorstep.
From a personal scale, to familial, to paranormal, to cosmic; shit gets wacky.
<br>
Following the titular protagonist's journey throughout the film is hard.
He easily earns sympathy, and that's what make the horrors he faces painful to sit through--especially as some of them are easy to connect with.
It feels so layered and so real, even to the point where it might be uncomfortable for some viewers.
<br>
To close:
The horror isn't the grotesque bunny suit, it's everything that comes with.
