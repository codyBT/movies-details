      <h2 id="zodiac">Entry 1. Zodiac</h2>
      <h6>Date: 9/20/20 - Stars: 5/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>With a little something for everyone, Zodiac makes for a killer movie night pick.
This film boasts an immersive score and captivating cinematography.
The writing and the chemistry between actors feels natural, and it's fun seeing familiar faces in different places.
It's easy to feel like you're actually there.
<br>
For the most part, this movie sticks closely to the true events.
Something to be appreciated is that Zodiac doesn't actually focus on the titular killer.
Instead, the spotlight is focused on the ones whose lives were reshaped in their plight to bring him to light.
<br>
There's something inspiring about this movie, and that something is worth watching for.
</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="darko">Entry 2. Donnie Darko</h2>
      <h6>Date: 9/21/20 - Stars: 5/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>Donnie Darko is a work of art that's equal parts compelling, horrifying, and thought-provoking.
<br>
It's hard to delve into what's lovable about this film with getting into spoilers, but I'll do my best.
This film uses story devices (horror tropes, teenage angst, etc.) as vehicles to drop ideas and questions at your doorstep.
From a personal scale, to familial, to paranormal, to cosmic; stuff gets wacky.
<br>
Following the titular protagonist's journey throughout the film is easy to start but hard to sit through.
He easily earns sympathy, and that's what make the horrors he faces painful to see--especially as some of them are easy to connect with.
It feels so layered and so real, even to the point where it might be uncomfortable for some viewers.
<br>
To close:
The horror isn't the grotesque bunny suit, it's everything that comes with.

       <h2 id="enemy">Entry 3. Enemy</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/2/20 - Stars: 2/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
An artsy movie telling an unclear story, Enemy (2013) cycles its focus between Jake Gyllenhaal, spiders, and sex. 
I'm something of a Jake Gyllenhaal fan--I'm trying to be, at least--and I love spiders, so I vibed with those. 
The sex? Not so much.
It's a matter of preference, but the quantities of nudity and onscreen 'relations' came across as gratuitous. 
Aside from that, the last primary element I detected was depressed people having mental breakdowns. 
Repeat those four things for an hour and a half, and that's the movie!
<br>
Moving on, the plot was decent, albeit muddy at times. 
The concept of having a doppelgänger is fascinating, and Gyllenhaal executes both characters wonderfully. 
Props to him for giving 110% as always. 
The supporting actresses Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon play their roles well. 
If nothing else, this movie boasts excellent actors.
<br>
To conclude, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you love speculation, and you're comfortable with nudity. 
All in all, I don't regret watching Enemy, and I'm looking forward to the next movie on my list.

      <h2 id="tdat">Entry 4. The Day After Tomorrow</h2>
      <h6>Date: 12/4/20 - Stars: 4/5</h6>
      <div class="box">
       <p>
The Day After Tomorrow (2004) is a visually appealing movie with characters and relationships that are easy to get invested in. 
<br>
First off, Dennis Quaid--of Jurassic Park fame--is here! 
He and Jake Gyllenhaal star respectively as the father and son protagonists, Jack and Sam Hall. 
Jack's a climatologist, Sam's a dork, and they're both likable. 
The focus switches between several groups of characters, and at no point did I feel tired of any of them. 
Balancing personalities, plot relevance, screentime, and emotional investment across character groups isn't easy; but this movie pulls it off incredibly well. 
<br>
This film's premise depends on climate change. 
Other political thoughts in the same left-leaning vein are touched on. 
If you're a conservative, just cover your ears or something. 
<br>
Striking visuals and likable characters sold this movie for me. 
A solidly great movie, The Day After Tomorrow earned its place in my action-adventure blockbuster heart.
