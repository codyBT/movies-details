        <p>Surprisingly true to the original events, Zodiac makes for a killer movie night.<br>
Coming from a background of superhero movies and Hallmark movies, I felt right at home watching this.
From the score's inmersive atmosphere, to the period-appropriate hairstyles, to the framing of scenes with the murderer; Zodiac plays out like a carefully crafted masterpiece.
The pacing seems to dip at times, but the second Gyllenhaal steps onto the scene as Graysmith for the third act, all sins are forgiven, and thensome.
His acting <em>could</em> carry the movie, but it doesn't have to.
He, RDJ, Ruffalo, and Edwards all give life to the people they portray.
Living, breathing, <strong>people</strong> whose lives were altered because that elusive, titular murderer.<br>
The Zodiac Killer.<br>

        <p>Human.<br>
  If I had to choose one word to describe Donnie Darko--the movie or the character--I would use human.<br>
  Nobody was assigned hero at birth.
Characters developed into who they were by circumstances forced upon them, and how they chose to respond.
There's a philosophical theme to the film that touches on religion, pre-determined fate, and smurf genitals.
The things we base our lives around, the things that scare us, and the things no one could've predicted.<br>
  As a character, Donnie Darko is impossibly easy to relate to and sympathize with.
As a movie, Donnie Darko hides serious, legitimate thoughts in a rabbit suit.
The scariest part isn't what's marketed.<br>
  Regardless, if you have some time to mull over existential and emotional questions in a safe environment, try watching it.</p>
